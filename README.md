#### NES DPCM Filter
This is a plugin that emulates the usage of the DPCM driver found in the Ricoh 2A03.

<sup>This might create high pitched ringing. It is recommended to run this with a bandpass at the resonant frequency.</sup>

#### Toms Midi Display (WIP - will be worked on after the Driver file is done!)
This is based on Tom's Midi display (TMIDI) which is a separate executable!
It shows realtime MIDI inputs and shows the last two controls used per channel.*

*<sup>Full functionality is not implemented due to more research in midi parsing.</sup>

#### ZYL REA-UI MIDI Driver
This midi driver is meant to facilitate the use of midi composing for users and coders alike.
This is an answer to DominoMIDI, a plugin that can do extensive manual midi writes.
With this plugin i am aiming to make it easy to do alot of otherwise patchy events like envelopes and pitch automations.
This is indirectly responsible for researching the Midi Display mentioned above.
