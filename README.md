#### NES DPCM Filter
This is a plugin that emulates the usage of the DPCM driver found in the Ricoh 2A03.

Fixed the high pitched ringing with some very crude checks. This may affect playback of quiet samples!

#### Toms Midi Display (WIP - will be worked on after the Driver file is done!)
This is based on Tom's Midi display (TMIDI) which is a separate executable!
It shows realtime MIDI inputs and shows the last two controls used per channel.
Finally with full display support!

#### ZYL REA-UI MIDI Driver
This midi driver is meant to facilitate the use of midi composing for users and coders alike.
This is an answer to DominoMIDI, a plugin that can do extensive manual midi writes.
With this plugin i am aiming to make it easy to do alot of otherwise patchy events like envelopes and pitch automations.
This is indirectly responsible for researching the Midi Display mentioned above.
